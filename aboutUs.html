  <!-- <p id="aboutUs">
    Grenade Flavored Water was founded on the principle that massive profits could be had by making tools that make corporate life easier.  Why do something hard that takes work when you can
    literally just pay a small fee to an awesome animal conscious organization that will do it all for you.  With our latest tool, the Values Generator, we take the hard work and mentally taxing
    challenge of directing your company or corporations' value initiatives off of your shoulders.  That's right!  In seconds you'll have a fully formed value initiative that your company can get
    behind and that will make you a rockstar of business.  Forget about spending months in conference rooms agonizing over what the W in POWER should stand for.  WE GOT YOU FAM!  All proceeds and
    monies earned by the Values Generator go directly into our pockets for our own personal gain and wealth. We believe in being wealthy and we believing in making people feel small because of our
    enormous wealth.  So you can sleep well at night knowing that you are contributing to making someone's life better.  Namely, ours.

    <h3>ARE YOUR HAIR AND BEARDS THAT EPIC?</h3>
    <p id="aboutUs">
      We won't lie to you.  66% of us are really attractive. Which only makes our ability to inspire you stronger.  For years we have supplemented our good business sense with our ridiculously good
      looks.  The truth is people trust symmetry.  Look it up.  It's a thing.  With 66% of our crew running at 100% symmetry we've been able to re-establish boundaries that people previously thought un-re-establish-able.
      We have redefined the undefined and returned value where there was once only null.  But no.  Literally none of us have epic beards.
