## Corporate Culture Values Generator

**Idea:** 

Create a visually pleasing Corporate Culture Values Generator for Human Resources or Culture Consultants.  User will input a word -ex. Power- and the generator will create a value initiative around that word. -ex. P for Progressive O for Ownership etc. etc.  However, the generator will be chock full of ridiculousness and mock culture buzz words.  

**Languages:** 

HTML/CSS/Javascript/JQuery/Bootstrap libraries used

**Intent:** 

To provide goofy and probably completely useless value initiatives for those that want to embrace the psychological idea behind corporate culture initiatives.  Embrace your inner chi and power belief into powerful collaborative change!

**Branches:** 

This is a relatively small project so no test branches or merged projects with multiple collaborators.  Just me and my master branch. To date, no files have been minified or beautified for speed or optimization.  All hosting is done via github pages.  As of this writing there is just the JS/HTML/CSS files in the master.  All assets are made via calls/gets/libraries/API etc.  Again, it's a simple project. 

**Future expansion:**

- [ ] Move Corporate Letter/Saying arrays/categories etc. to Data Base
- [ ] Learn Data Base language/use (maybe do this first)
- [ ] Refactor code for scalability and readability
- [x] Incorporate Dictionary API to enhance the users input with defs and other suggestions
- [ ] Add about us and contact page that will support email submission of new culture initiatives/sayings/acronyms
- [ ] Minify, combine and compress files for optimization and hosting
- [ ] Implement work flow to push submitted ideas to database if approved
